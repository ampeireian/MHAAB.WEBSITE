    <p class="auto-style3">1. Why we exist?</p>
    <p>
        According to WHO report, (2017) entitled “Depression and other common mental disorders: Global Health Estimates”, Uganda has been ranked 6th in Africa with the highest cases of mental disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
        The World Health Organization’s global status report on Alcohol, 2014 stated that Uganda has one of the highest alcohol and substance abuse rates in the World. With over half of Uganda’s population aged below 24 years, school-going adolescents and young people are part of these statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Various factors have been mentioned to lead to mental disorders. These include interpersonal problems in marriage and relationships, economic difficulties, sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, unemployment, poor housing in cities, and chronic health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other illnesses. Owing to the increased cases of mental health disorders and the aftereffects such as suicide, mental health awareness and beyond highlighted the need for increased community awareness so that community members can recognize signs of psychological distress, including signs of increased risk for suicide among relatives so that they can quickly take them for professional mental health care before they get to the final stage of the suicidal spectrum. However, these services are lacking (Jjingo, 2015). It is against these that MHAAB Uganda exists with an aim of combining efforts with other stakeholders to lend a helping hand in scaling down the magnitude of mental health disorders that are increasing at an alarming rate in urban and rural settings alike.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style3">2. BACKGROUND</p>
    <p>
        Mental health awareness and beyond (MHAAB) is a non-governmental, non-partisan, and not-for-profit organization. It was created in June 2016 with the aim of promoting mental health awareness and preventing mental disorders. This was after realizing how clients with mental illness were neglected and abandoned by their own families and communities in hospitals even after recovery. It was duly incorporated in November 2017 with the registrar of companies and is fully registered under the Republic of Uganda's Non-Governmental Organizations Act, 2016 as a national NGO.
